	You can also you the following tool: 
	<a href="http://www.stoer.de/ipod/ipod_en.htm">Outpod</a>. 
	Outpod is a program to do bulk exports of contact and calendar

	vCard and vCalendar standard (vCalendar format is not yet 
	supported by Brim).

		How do I use the QuickMark functionality and what about the 
		installation path?
	</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
	The QuickMark is a special bookmark. You need to add this link to 
	the bookmarks in your browser.  The next time you visit a page you 
	want to bookmark in Brim (and not your browser), you click on the 
	QuickMark bookmark in your browser and the link will be added to Brim. 
	For this, the QuickMark functionality needs to know the installation 
	path (something like: <code>http://www.yourhost.com/brim</code>). The 
	administrator of the application can set this path via the application 
	configuration.

		How do I  install brim in an existing database, used by another application?

	<p>
		<b>Question:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		My web server only allows once Mysql database; 
		I am this database using for wordpress (a blog program)
	</p>
	<p>	
		I am wondering how to intall Brim without upsetting the 
		part of Mysql which Wordpress uses. In wordpress, a 
		$table_prefix has been specified as a database prefix - 
		the prefix is wp_. The purpose of this is to allow
		multiple wordpress configurations.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Answer:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can safely install brim next to any other program 
		using the same database.  Brim uses a fixed table prefix 
		(brim_) so it does not clash with other table 
		names. You can only install one version of brim per database though....

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#cccccc">
	<b>
		I get the following error:  
		<code>Fatal error: Call to undefined function mysql_connect()</code>
	</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
	This means that you do not have the mysql extension compiled. 
	Install the php-mysql extenstion or recompile php with this 
	option enabled.
</td>

	<b>
		The GMail plugin doesn't show up
	</b>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
	This means that you do not have the php libcurl extenstion installed. 
	For more information, look here:
	<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a> and here: 
	<a href="http://www.php.net/curl">http://www.php.net/curl</a>

		The DepotTracker and Collections plugin don't show up

	<b>
		I get an error indicating the some files are not found
	</b>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
	Do you get an error message similar to the following?
	<pre>
	Warning: main(framework/Controller.php): 
		failed to open stream: No such file or directory in 
		/home/brim/public_html/brim/framework/DashboardController.php 
		on line 3

	Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required 'framework/Controller.php' 
		(include_path='/usr/share/php') 
		in /home/brim/public_html/brim/framework/DashboardController.php 
		on line 3
	</pre>

	This means that your include path is incorrect. Your include path MUST 
	contain the current directory, so you need to edit your php.ini file and 
	add the current directory ('.') to your include path. For instance:
	<pre>
		include_path = "/usr/share/php"
	</pre>
	Should become
	<pre>
		include_path = ".:/usr/share/php"
	</pre>
	Remember to restart the http server after applying the changes!

		I want to modify some files on my webserver, but I

</td>

<tr>
	<td>
		If you use the unpack utility provided with the brim installation, 
		you upload the brim-xxx.tar.gz file and the unpack.php file. 
		Afterwards, you tell the webserver (by using the unpack utility) i
		to unpack all files. At this moment, the webserver becomes the owner 
		of those files and you are no longer allowed to modify any of those 
		files anymore.  The workaround is that you unpack all files locally 
		and upload them (via ftp) individually.

	With FREE and Online, sessions operate in a particular way: you

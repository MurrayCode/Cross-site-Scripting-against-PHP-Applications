			I am very interested in your experiences with Brim.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the installation/upgrade easy and straightforward or 
			are there things missing?</li>
			<li>Does the application meet your expectations?</li>
			<li>Are there things missing?</li>
			<li>...etc...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You can send comments directly to me but preferable 
			you can add 
			them to the forum where other can respond to your
			questions/remarks as well.

			Upgrading the script basically follows the same steps as 
			installing it. Since you already did the installation
			once, I will keep it short. In case of problems, read the
			<a href="installation_guide.html">installation guide</a>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unzip the file that contains the package</li>
			<li>You will now have several files, amongst these are the 'unpack.php', 'Tar.php' and
				a gzipped tar-file (extension .tar.gz). These three files need to be
				copied/ftp-ed to your webserver.</li>
			<li>Execute the unpack script via your webbrowser (older files will be overwritten, 
				no need to remove them first)</li>
			<li>Execute the installation script (install.php. If all goes well, the unpack script shows a link 
				to the installation script). The installation script also takes care of updates, it
				uses the existing database configuration file to retrieve information about the
				existing tables and possibly perform an upgrade where necessary).</li>
			<li>Remove the installation files</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If the unpack script fails, you need to unpack the gzipped tar-file locally 
			and upload each file individually. Proceed with the installation script afterwards

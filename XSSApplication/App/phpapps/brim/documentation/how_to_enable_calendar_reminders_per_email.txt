It is now possible to send out email reminders for events via brim.
(This currently only works for non-recurring events)

There are a few things to consider:
- Each user must have a valid email address associated to its account
- You must have crontab (or equivalent) access
- You must be able to access a mailserver from your installation

How to enable reminders for calendar events sent out per email?

*** STEP 1 ***
You need to add a line to a crontab (or anything similar), that periodically executes and fetches a predefined page in Brim.

For unix, the following line executes the reminder mechanism each 5 minutes:
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://_YOUR_SERVER_HERE_/brim/brim.php?plugin=calendar\&username=calendar\&amp;action=sendReminders 

(Important to add the backslashes just before the ampersand!)

*** STEP 2 ***
Furthermore, you need to enable this feature as admin user.
Go to the configuration section and turn this option on, it will be disabled by default.

	<h2>Get rid of the files</h2>
	<p>
		If you have uploaded the files individually by
		ftp or something similar, you can simply delete	
		files.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have used the installation script, there is a bit more
		to do.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a file (locally) called 'delete.php' (any name is fine)</li>
		<li>Edit the file and put the following code in it (pressumed that the application is installed under the subdirectory called 'brim')</li>
	</ul>
	<pre>
		&lt;?php  
			unlink ('brim');  
		?&gt; 
	</pre>
	<ul>
		<li>Upload this file to your public webserver, one level higher than the application directory</li>
		<li>Execute the 'delete.php' script using your webbrowser</li>
		<li>Remove the file 'delete.php'</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Database cleanup</h2>
	<p>
		Now delete the brim database (execute something like 'drop database brim' using the commandline, phpMySQL, a similar tool)
		or delete all tables with the following prefix 'brim_', if the application is installed in a database shared with other applications
	</p>

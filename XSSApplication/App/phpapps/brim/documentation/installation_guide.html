		<p>
			I am very interested in your experiences with Brim.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Is the installation easy and straightforward or 
			are there things missing?</li>
			<li>Does the application meet your expectations?</li>
			<li>Are there things missing?</li>
			<li>...etc...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			You can send comments directly to me but preferable 
			you can add 
			them to the PHorum where other can respond to your
			questions/remarks as well.

			This installation guide is provided for those who

		<font color="red">
			If you reached this page in search for information

	<h1>Prerequisits</h1>
	<ul>
			<li>PHP (version 4.x or higher)</li>
			<li>an ADOdb compliant database, i.e. mysql/postgres</li>
	</ul>


	<a name="database" />
	<h1>Database installation</h1>
	<p>
		Read the database specific documentation. A MySQL setup
		(post-installation) example
		is provided
	</p>
	<h2>Example: Setup a MySQL environment</h2>
	<p>
		a. Startup mysql server/daemon<br />
		b. Set an admin password<br />
	</p>
		<pre>
			mysqladmin -u root password 'your-password'
		</pre>

	<h2>Create a database called 'brim'</h2>
	<p>
		The database name can be something else.
	</p>
	<pre>
		$ mysql [-u user] [-p]
		mysql &gt; create database brim;
		mysql &gt; quit
	</pre>
	or
	<pre>
		$ mysqladmin [-u user] [-p] create brim
	</pre>
	<h2>Create the table structure for the application</h2>
	<p>
		This step must be repeated for the framework and each 
		of its plugins!!!!
		If you do not want certain plugins to be installed, 
		delete their directories from the plugins directory or you will
		encounter errors (brim tries to dynamically load all
		plugins that are found in the plugin directory and will show errors
		if those plugins found are not installed)
	</p>
	<pre>
		$ mysql brim [-u user] [-p] &lt; 'path.to'/create.xxx.sql
	</pre>
	<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>
		If you are in the root directory of the brim application, 
		you will have to specify the following:
	</p>
	<pre>
		$ mysql brim [-u user] [-p] &lt; framework/sql/create.xxx.sql
		$ mysql brim [-u user] [-p] &lt; plugins/bookmarks/sql/create.xxx.sql
		$ mysql brim [-u user] [-p] &lt; plugins/calendar/sql/create.xxx.sql
		etc... (there are more plugins!)
	</pre>

	<h2>Setup permissions</h2>
	<pre>
		grant all rights to user
		$ mysql -u root -p

		mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON brim.* TO 'brim_admin' IDENTIFIED BY 'brim_admin'  WITH GRANT OPTION;
	</pre>
	<p>
		The user 'brim_admin' is the user that connects to the database. This is an arbitrary
		name, it can be anything. This user must have full rights on the database in which
		brim is installed however.
	</p>
		
	<h2> Edit the
		framework/configuration/databaseConfiguration.php file for the correct settings.
	</h2>
	<p>
		Your application will not work otherwise :-)
	</p>

	<h2>Setup the admin user</h2>
	<p>
		The application has one dedicated user called 'admin'. This is the only 
		user that is able to change application parameters.
		Install the admin user with an sql statement similar to:
	</p>
	<pre>
		INSERT INTO brim_users (loginname, password, name, email, description, when_created, last_login)
			VALUES ('admin', MD5('YOUR_PASSWORD'), 'Admin user', 'your.admin@email.address', 'A small description', NOW(), null);
	</pre>
	
	<h1>Check the installation</h1>
	<p>
		You should now be able to login using username/password 'admin'.
		Change the password via the preferences.
		If you encounter problems you can always contacts me at:
		contact me at:
		barry [at] nauta [dot] be
		or visit the projects website at <a href="http://www.brim-project.org/">http://www.brim-project.org/</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Please mention
	</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Which database (including version) you are using</li>
			<li>Which webserver (including version) you are using</li>
			<li>Which version of PHP you are using</li>
			<li>If possible, a dump of the <code>phpinfo()</code>
			command</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Finishing up</h2>
	<p>
		The admin section allows the addition
		of more users. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Delete the install.php script once installation is succesful!!!
		You might also want to delete the phpinfo.php file...
	</p>

	<p>

	<b><font color="red" size="+1">Do not forget to change the admin
					password!!!</font></b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Have fun :-)
	</p>

	<a name="troubleshooting" />
	<h1>Trouble shooting</h1>
	<p>
		If you have followed the steps and there are still problems,
		here are some more tips that might help or produce additional
		output which you can send me for evalutaion :-)
	</p>
	<ul>
<!--
			<li>Replace the reference to Smarty in the file
			<code>configs/MySmarty.php</code> by an absolution path</li>
-->
			<li>Replace the reference to ADOdb in the file
			<code>framework/util/databaseConnection</code> by an absolute
			path</li>
			<li>Append the debug option to the page you are requesting.
			This will produce (hopefully) additional output which might
			be helpfull. Adding the debug option is done by adding 
			<code>?debug=true</code> to the requested page. FOr
			instance: 
			<code>http://www.host.com/brim/index.php</code>
			becomes

			<code>http://www.host.com/brim/index.php?debug=true</code>
			</li>
		</ul>

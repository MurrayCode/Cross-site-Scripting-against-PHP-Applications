<h2>Email reminders for calendar events</h2>
<p>
	It is now possible to send out email reminders for events via brim.
	(This currently only works for non-recurring events)
</p>

<p>
There are a few things to consider:
<ul>
<li>Each user must have a valid email address associated to its account</li>
<li>You must have crontab (or equivalent) access</li>
<li>You must be able to access a mailserver from your installation</li>
</ul>

How to enable reminders for calendar events sent out per email?
<p/>

<h4>*** STEP 1 ***</h4>
<p>
	You need to add a line to a crontab (or anything similar), 
	that periodically executes and fetches a predefined page in Brim.
</p>

<p>
	For unix, the following line executes the reminder mechanism each 5 minutes:
	<code>
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/lynx --source http://_YOUR_SERVER_HERE_/brim/brim.php?plugin=calendar\&username=calendar\&amp;action=sendReminders 
	</code>
</p>
<p>
(Important to add the backslashes just before the ampersand!)
</p>

<h4>*** STEP 2 ***</h4>
<p>
	Furthermore, you need to enable this feature as admin user.
	Go to the configuration section and turn this option on, it will be disabled by default.

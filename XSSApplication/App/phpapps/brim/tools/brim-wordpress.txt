Requirements:
Brim 1.0.3 or higher

* Copy the file 'brim-wordpress.php' to your plugins directory in wordpress (typically 'wp-content/plugins').

* Edit the sidebar.php file (can be found in 'wp-content/themes/_your_theme_/')
of your template and add

	<li><h2>Brim - bookmarks</h2>
		<ul>
			<?php echo brim_bookmarks(); ?>
		</ul>
	</li>

* As admin user of wordpress, activate the Brim-bookmarks plugin.

* Via the options, select the brim-bookmarks plugin and edit the parameters
- absolute path is something like '/home/yourname/public_html/brim'
- URL for the Brim installation is something like 'http://yourhost/brim'
- Username for brim application is the username for which you would like
the public bookmarks to showup in wordpress.

* If you use non-standard characters, they will show up as strange characters in your bookmark tree. 
Set the characterset of the page to UTF8 to avoid this problem. 
Add the following to the HTML header of the page:
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">

Your brim plugin should now show up correctly in your wordpress installation, provided that you have items shared ;-)

If you see any errors, try to move the plugin to the end of the sidebar.php file.

Upload (ftp) the following files:

- Tar.php
- unpack.php
- brim_xxxx.tar.gz 

Upload them ONE DIRECTROY HIGHER than the final location for brim.
(i.e. /home/yourname/public_html if you want the final destination to be
/home/yourname/public_html/brim)

Execute the following:

chmod 644 Tar.php unpack.php brim*.gz
mkdir brim
chmod 777 brim (if this is a new install or an upgrade from brim 1.0.4) 
chmod -R 777 brim (if this is an upgrade from brim-1.0.0, brim 1.0.1 or brim 1.0.2)
(Note that some webservers require 755 instead, try this if you run into problems)

Now execute the unpack.php file from your webbrowser and follow the instructions
Remove the three files afterwards

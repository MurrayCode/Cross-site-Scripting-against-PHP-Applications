Hi Tom,

When I switched to Linux I successfully converted my .pst files to mbox
format, together with my Outlook contacts and imported them into
Evolution. It's a fairly convoluted process, but it worked for me.

If you have a strong stomach (or masochistic tendencies), make yourself
a large pot of coffee (or something stronger) and give this a try:

***********************************************************************

Mozilla under Windows can access the .pst Outlook files because it can
use the Windows MAPI.DLL library. Using MAPI.DLL is the only way to
access .pst files, and it can be used under a Windows operating system.

To start importing your Outlook mail to Evolution, run Mozilla Mail on
Windows and select the Importer to begin:

File > Import

Then select the .pst file that you wish to import Mail from Outlook.
Once Mozilla has imported all your mail, reboot your computer into
Linux.

Mount your Windows partition in Linux and run Evolution to begin
importing your mail. Select the Importer from the File menu to start
importing:

File > Import File...

Set the file type to "MBox (mbox)" and click on [Browse] to select the
file containing mail you want to import.

If you are the only user on Windows, the mail files will be stored in
/mnt/windows/c/Windows/Application
Data/Mozilla/Profiles/default/XXXX/Mail/imported.mail/ where
/mnt/windows/c/ is your windows partition mount point and XXXX is some
collection of numbers and digits ending in .slt.

If there is more than one user, the file will be in
/mnt/windows/c/windows/Profiles/USERNAME/XXXX/ Mail/imported.mail/ where
USERNAME is your Windows username.

For each mail folder in Outlook, Mozilla will convert the folder into
one mbox file. To import all your mail, import all the files into
Evolution, that do not a .msf extension.

ALTERNATIVELY

You may want to get the conversion program libpst-0.3beta1.tgz which can
be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ol2mbox/

**************************************************************************

To import your contacts from Outlook you will need to export all of your
contact folders in Outlook to a .csv file. To do this in Outlook:

Click on File > Import and Export....
Choose "Export to a file" and click [Next].
For the file type choose "Comma Separated Values (DOS)".
Click [Next].
If you have sub-folders under "Contacts" each sub-folder must be
exported separately.
Name the exported files "same_as_outlook_folder.csv" (sans quotes and
keep a note of the path).
Click [Next].
Click [Finish].

To import contacts.csv into Evolution you will have to run each .csv
file through the attached Perl script (csv2vcard.pl). Download
csv2vcard.pl into your home directory and make the script executable by
running this command:

$ chmod +x ~/csv2vcard.pl

Run this script to convert contacts.csv to contacts.vcf:

$ ./csv2vcard.pl contacts.csv contacts.vcf

Once you have contacts.vcf, you can import it into Evolution by:

Clicking File > Import.
Click [Next].
Click on "Import from a single file"
Click [Next] again.
For file type choose "VCard...".
Click [Browse] and select your file.
Click [Next] then [Import].

**************************************************************************

Hope this helps and good luck.

Dave

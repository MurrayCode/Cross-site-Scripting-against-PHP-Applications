Here are some really encoded/ crypted passwords:


- LDAP root bind password (variable '$rootBindPw', base64 encoded; This
password must be encoded manually by a tool or by the base64_encode PHP
function):

"manager" ==> "bWFuYWdlcg=="
"admin" ==> "YWRtaW4="


- user password within the LDAP entry (attribute 'userPassword', md5
crypted; This password is crypted by the LdapReam when setting the
password):

"secrect" ==> "{MD5}Xr4ilOzQ4PCOq3aQ0qbuaQ=="
"admin" ==> "{MD5}ISMvKXpXpadDiUoOSoAfww=="

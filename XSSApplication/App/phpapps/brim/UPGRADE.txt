Always make a backup of your database!!!

*** Upgrade from a previous Brim version to the latest

- Execute the install.php script (by opening it via your browser),
this script will also take care of updates and delete it afterwards.

*** Upgrading from Booby to Brim

- Make a backup of your data (there is a database dump utility in the
Booby administration section, you can also use tools like phpMyAdmin
or the good old CLI ;-)

- Upgrade to the latest version (1.0.1) of Booby afterwards.

- Edit the framework/configuration/databaseConfiguration.php file.
For an initial installation, this file is not there, rename the 
databaseConfiguration.example.php file. 
You can also copy the 'old' Booby databaseConfiguration file in 
this directory.
Note that if your previous database was called 'booby', you can keep 
this name, the application works with any database name.

- Execute the 'tools/booby2brim.php' script via your browser

- Delete the 'tools/booby2brim.php' file

- Now run the install.php file in the application
root (to add the new collections plugin)

- Delete the install.php file in the application root

In case the application is installed under a different directory than Booby, 
notify your users that the quickmark functionality needs to be reinitiated.

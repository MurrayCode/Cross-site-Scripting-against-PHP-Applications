USING WIDGETS
=============

To activate widgets, this is not yet supported in the interface of the
bilboplanet 1.0beta version. So you will have to create it manually.

The way to use it is first to create your widget, and then to specify in the
database where it can find your widget and where it has to be placed

1) Create the widget
The widgets has to be in the /widget folder. Create a PHP file and in that
file create a function called "getWidget". This function has to return an array
with the following form :
array(
	"id" => "one_word_name",
	"title" => "My super widget",
	"html" => "here you will find the content of your widget"
);


2) Specifying to the database to load it
Once your widget is ready to be set in production, go to into the bilboplanet database
and in the table "settings" add an entry called : "planet_widget_files" in which you will
put data in json format :
[
	{"name" : "YourwidgetName.php", "position" : "sidebar"},
	{"name" : "Yoursecondwidget.php", "position" : "footer"}
]

Note : there are only two positions supported actually : sidebar and footer

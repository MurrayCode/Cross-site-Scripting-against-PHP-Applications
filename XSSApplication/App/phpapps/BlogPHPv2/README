To install:
- Extract contents (in order for the stats program to work please put in a main directory or sub-domain....it will not work in something like mysite.com/testing/blog)
- Edit config.php with your mysql info and set the other variables such as table prefix
- Upload files into public_html and chmod 777 the "upload" folder (do NOT upload the files into the upload folder,
the upload folder is for the file module only)
- Run install.php in your browser and follow the steps, then you are done!


WHAT IS DATECHANGE.PHP?
- I figured I would include it, it is a simple tool to manually update the date of a blog entry.
This is good if you are transfering blogs manually but want to keep the date intact.

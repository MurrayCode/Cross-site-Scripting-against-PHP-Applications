PHP-App-Cross-Site-Scripting-Testbed
Purpose: This application has been designed to allow the user to practice Cross-site Scripting techniques against real applications without the hassle of installing the apps. It has been build under "Uniform Server" (UniServerZ) which is a free lightweight WAMP (Windows/Apache/MySQL/Php) server solution for Windows. UniServerZ runs from a USB (or in this case, a single folder). The vulnerable PHP apps have been downloaded mainly from https://www.exploit-db.com

The apps can be exploited (1) Using manual techniques (2) Using exploits that are available on the Internet (e.g. exploit-db.com or github). There are exploits available for each of these apps (I have checked to make sure they work).
